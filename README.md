# Cloder - Connect in Real Life

## What is Cloder?

Cloder is an app designed to help you make meaningful, authentic friendships through **in-person meetups**. We're bringing back the joy of face-to-face connections in a world that's gone digital-only.

## The Problem

Tired of endless texting that never leads anywhere? Frustrated by digital-only friendships? You're not alone. Modern social apps have made it easier to "connect" online, but harder to actually meet people in real life.

## The Solution

Cloder takes a different approach:

### 1. **Share Your Availability**
Tell us when you're free for in-person meetups. No more back-and-forth scheduling—just set your availability once.

### 2. **Get Matched by Time & Interests**
Our smart matching system connects you with people who:
- Share your interests and passions
- Are available at the same times as you
- Actually want to meet in person

### 3. **Meet Face-to-Face**
Skip the endless texting and meet in real life. That's where real friendships begin.

## Core Features

- **🎯 Availability-Based Matching**: Get matched with people who are free when you are
- **👤 Authentic Profiles**: Share your genuine interests and find others who appreciate you
- **🤝 Real Connections**: Designed to get you meeting people in person, not stuck in chat
- **🔒 Safe & Secure**: Meet in public places with built-in safety tools and content moderation
- **🌟 Community Driven**: Join people who value face-to-face connections

## How It's Different

Unlike other apps that keep you scrolling and texting forever, Cloder is built specifically to get you **offline and meeting people**. We match based on both interests AND availability, so you can actually make plans that work.
